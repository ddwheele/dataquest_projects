
About the Civil Rights Data Collection

The purpose of the U.S. Department of Education (ED) Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) is to obtain data related to the nation’s public school districts and elementary and secondary schools’ obligation to provide equal educational opportunity. Since 1968, the CRDC has collected a variety of information, including student enrollment and educational programs and services data that are disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, limited English proficiency, and disability, about
public schools across the nation.

The CRDC is a mandatory data collection, authorized under the statutes and regulations implementing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and under the Department of Education Organization Act (20 U.S.C. § 3413). The regulations implementing these provisions can be found at 34 CFR 100.6(b); 34
CFR 106.71; and 34 CFR 104.61.

The 2013-14 CRDC is a universe survey. School districts self-report and certify all data presented.
